## NOTICE

This repository is a easyOpenCV implemenation of our SkyStone detector.  

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository is built off the 5.2 version of the SkyStone repository in combination with the easyOpenCV library.

## Getting Started
You can download this repository and simply install on your phone.  It uses a default 320, 240 image which can be changes to fit your phone.  The detector uses three locations on the screen to measure level of color.  We use these levels to detect the SkyStone.  The white dots on the screen represent the sampling location while the red dot indicates which block has been chosen.  The vertical line is there to use for lining up the phone to the block or object of your choosing.

## Downloading the Project

Download and install just as you would any other github project.
